## Compatibility

* OpenCart 2.3, 3.x.

## Installation

- Copy the files from the archive (from the `upload` folder) to the root directory of your site (do not replace existing files).
- Go to "Extensions" > "Modules". Install the Image Gallery module.
- After installation, three buttons (Albums/Modules/Settings) will appear at the top-left corner of all module pages.
- In the module settings page, select layouts for product/category/error pages. If the error page layout is missing, add it in "System/Design/Layouts" by specifying the path `error/not_found` and then select it in the module settings. **Do not skip this step; it is essential for SEO and module functionality.**
- Create at least one album.
- Go to the Modules section, where an SEO hook module will be created to enable SEO-friendly URLs. Place this module on the site's error page layout and click "Save."
- That's it! You can now add the XML feed to Google, Yandex, or other search engines. The XML feed is located at: `http://your-site-address/index.php?route=feed/gallery`

## Management

The module is simple, no manual is required, everything is in the description and hints.
